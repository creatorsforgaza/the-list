    "text": "What is Creators for Gaza?\nWe are a SWANA-led global collective fundraising for Palestinians we know and love in Gaza. Each of our campaigns supports someone we personally know, or are connected to locally. With our collective efforts, we have raised more than $1.5 million for our 50 families. You can make a difference, and build solidarity with Gaza.\n\n\nWhat is a Creator?\nA creator is someone who creates social media content or/ and in-person events to fundraise for one of our families in Gaza. A creator is someone who is excited to make stuff or to post online, and connected to us and to family on social media. By signing up to become a creator with us, you will be committing to taking on one of our family campaigns and committing to consistently amplifying their campaign.\nYou will be paired up with a family’s campaign, and put in touch with the contact for that campaign. Create whatever type of post or experience for whatever platform you like - illustration, image carousel, reel, tiktok, raffle, service offering, fundraising event, the list is endless. The aim is to bring attention to the campaign with something in a shareable way that highlights that our Palestinian families in Gaza are not numbers. You can help our families feel seen and amplify their stories.\nMany of our creators make art for our families’ campaigns, but folx have also created raffles, auctions, and merch to do online fundraising, while others have organized events in their hometowns, like bake sales, game nights, benefit shows, and movie screenings. The possibilities are endless and the limit is your creativity and personal skill set. Please check our instagram for examples of how others have done this. There is a place in this work for quite literally everyone, regardless of whether you consider yourself to be “creative”.\nWhen you sign up you will also be invited to a supportive and collaborative group chat of other Creators doing the same work. You don’t have to figure out how to reinvent a wheel, you just have to plug into the work already being done.\n\n\nHow do I join Creators for Gaza?\nSign up here! We’ll email you a specific family’s campaign, and your contact for the campaign. You’ll get to know the family’s needs and start creating a fundraising effort.\n\n\nCan’t quite commit to being a creator?\nHelp support creators and families on your own by printing and disseminating resources. Many creators have volunteered their time and talents, you can help by passing out flyers, zines and handbills around your neighborhood and local businesses.\n\n\nHow do I add a family to your list/database?\nWe are not currently adding new families. We are still fundraising for the families we are committed to and have a list of their relatives and community from which we will add from if/when possible. We understand that there is great need and lots of urgency, but we believe in commitment and consistency in supporting the folx we have taken on.\n\n\nHow are your campaigns verified?\nWe know the folx we support through personal connections of family and community. The families we support know best what they need and we offer them that support as we can.\n\n\nWhy are you still fundraising? Hasn’t a ceasefire been called?\nThe implementation of a ceasefire doesn’t magically make everyone’s needs disappear. Our families have so far managed to survive The Genocide, but the ceasefire is fragile and every other ceasefire has been broken. The loss of infrastructure in Gaza is unparalleled in modern history. Our families’ homes, workplaces, schools, and infrastructure have been destroyed. Their friends and family members have been murdered by the occupation forces. Our tax dollars paid for this. We owe Palestinians in Gaza the world, and continuing to fundraise for their needs to be met is quite literally the least we can and should do.\n\n\nIf the Rafah border crossing is closed, what is the money being used for?\nWithout the ability to evacuate, our friends in Gaza are using the money from their campaigns to survive. They are buying food and water, paying for what medicines they can find, paying for lodging, toiletries, and anything they need for basic necessities. If / when the border opens we will reassess how to best support our families. If the ceasefire holds, Palestinians in Gaza will decide whether to evacuate, reunite with family, or pursue medical care, education, or some other need. Others will choose to stay on their land and rebuild their lives. We support our families in whatever choices they need to make.\n\n\nWhich family/campaign should I donate to?\nAny! We are connected to each of these families, and every one is in dire need of help. Each of these families is someone we know personally, or is connected to our people.\n\n\nHow does the money raised reach the families in Gaza?\nThe gofundme/chuffed campaign organizer coordinates and electronically transfers funds directly to the family. Our job is to raise funds.\n\n\nCan you set up a gofundme/fundraiser for my family?\nWe do not create fundraisers. Our role is to amplify fundraisers that already exist, from people and families we are connected to.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
