We are a mutual-aid network connecting artists and amplifiers with our Gazan families evacuating the genocide. Each of our campaigns supports someone we personally know, or are connected to locally.

Gazans must pay upwards of $5,000+ per person to register individuals to cross the border into Egypt. Together, the over 40 campaigns we have made art for and supported have raised over a million US dollars and ??? individuals have been able to evacuate.

This initiative is led by Sheyam Ghieth and Eva Lindquist, SWANA organizers in Multnomah/Clackamas/Chinook/Cowlitz land, (so-called Portland, OR) and includes creators and fundraisers from across the globe.
